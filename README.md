### Everbuzz Bot: Endurance Upgrade Optimizer for Honeyland Documentation

---

#### Introduction:

Welcome to the Shard Optimization Discord Bot documentation. This bot provides a suite of tools designed to help users optimize their shard usage in a game setting, factoring in various parameters like costs, boosts, and zone thresholds. Leveraging dynamic programming algorithms, players can determine the cheapest ways to upgrade their stats and reach desired zones in a user-friendly manner.

---

#### Basic Setup:

1. **Bot Initialization**: To initialize the bot, ensure it's running. The bot uses the `discord` Python package to communicate with the Discord API. Once active, the bot will display a confirmation message, signifying a successful login.
2. **Intents**: The bot operates with `intents`, a Discord API feature that grants bots access to specific events. This bot is equipped to handle all events.

---

#### Command Overview:

Users can harness two primary commands:

1. **$shard**: Calculates and suggests an optimal path to reach a designated zone based on the present stats and a level cap.
2. **$cost**: An extension of the `$shard` command that also takes into account the costs associated with upgrades and shards.

#### Command Usage:

1. **$shard**: 
   - **Usage**: `$shard <current_stat> <level_cap> <desired_zone>`
   - **Description**: With the current stats, level cap, and desired zone as inputs, this command yields the most efficient route to achieve the specified zone.
   - **Example**: `$shard 150 20 5` - The bot will strategize the best approach to get to Zone 5 with a starting stat of 150 and an allowable level cap of 20.

2. **$cost**:
   - **Usage**: `$cost <current_stat> <level_cap> <desired_zone> <upgrade_cost> <shard_cost>`
   - **Description**: This command integrates the costs of upgrades and shards, offering users a cost-effective path to their desired zone.
   - **Example**: `$cost 150 20 5 1 4` - Users will receive guidance on navigating to Zone 5 starting from a stat of 150, with a level cap of 20, each upgrade costing 1 unit, and each shard priced at 4 units.

  - The bot recognizes these shard types:
    - `c`: Common
    - `r`: Rare
    - `e`: Epic
    - `l`: Legendary
    - `m`: Mythic
    - `all`: All types

- **Zone Thresholds**: Predefined zone thresholds are embedded in the bot's logic, determining a user's zone placement based on their stat.

- **Errors and Validations**: Comprehensive error handling ensures that any erroneous inputs or internal issues result in user-friendly error messages. These messages guide the user towards the correct path.
